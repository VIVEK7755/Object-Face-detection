# Object-Face-detection

This is a object detection model developed in Python which process the images by collecting the data and its features. In live it detects the Objects/Faces .

Libraries used  for the model are OpenCV, Tensorflow and OS for the  collecting images.

In backend, Labelling tool is used  to label the objects to be trained and tested in the model. Single-Shot Detection(SSD) neural network is used to train the model.
