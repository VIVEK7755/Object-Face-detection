#Object-Face-detection with Tensorflow

1. **Title and Introduction**:

   # Object Detection with TensorFlow README

   This repository contains code for collecting images, labeling them, training an object detection model, and using the trained model to detect objects or faces in real-time using a webcam feed.
  

2. **Getting Started**:

   Explain the prerequisites and setup required to run the code. Mention any libraries or dependencies that need to be installed.

   ```markdown
   ## Getting Started

   Before running the code, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

   - Python (version X.X)
   - TensorFlow (version X.X)
   - OpenCV (version X.X)
   - ... (list other dependencies)

   You can install the required Python packages using pip:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   ```

3. **Collecting Images**:

   Describe the code responsible for collecting images from a webcam for different object classes. Explain how to run this code and provide any necessary command-line arguments.

   ```markdown
   ## Collecting Images

   The `collect_images.py` script captures images from a webcam for various object classes. To use it, run the following command:
   ~python collect_images.py
   ```
   
   ```

   You can customize the list of object classes and the number of images to capture in the script.
   ```

4. **Labeling Images**:

   Explain how to label the collected images using the LabelImg tool. Provide the necessary instructions and commands.

   ```markdown
   ## Labeling Images

   To label the collected images, follow these steps:

   1. Clone the LabelImg tool repository:

      ```
      git clone https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg labelImg
      ```

   2. Run the LabelImg tool:

      ~cd labelImg
      ~python labelImg.py

      ```
      ```

   Use the tool to draw bounding boxes around objects in the images and save the annotations.

   ```

5. **Training the Model**:

   Explain how to train the object detection model using TensorFlow. Include instructions for generating TFRecord files, configuring the pipeline, and running the training script.

   ```markdown
   ## Training the Model

   To train the object detection model, follow these steps:

   1. Generate TFRecord files for training and testing data:
      ~python generate_tfrecord.py -x path/to/training/images -i path/to/training/images -l path/to/annotations/label_map.pbtxt -o path/to/output/train.record
      ~python generate_tfrecord.py -x path/to/testing/images -i path/to/testing/images -l path/to/annotations/label_map.pbtxt -o path/to/output/test.record

      ```
      

   2. Configure the pipeline by editing `mymodel/pipeline.config`.

   3. Start training the model:

      ```
      ~python model_main_tf2.py --model_dir mymodel --num_train_steps 5000 --pipeline_config_path mymodel/pipeline.config
      ```


6. **Real-time Object Detection**:

   Explain how to use the trained model to perform real-time object detection using a webcam feed.

   ```markdown
   ## Real-time Object Detection

   Run the following script to perform real-time object detection using the trained model:
   ~python real_time_object_detection.py

   ```
   
   ```

   This script will open your webcam and display the live feed with detected objects.

   ```

7. **Conclusion**:

   Summarize the purpose and key features of the code. Optionally, provide contact information or links to additional resources.

   ```markdown
